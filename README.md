Week 4 Lab

# about-me
I work a job, own a clothing brand (647even.ca), and also study at Markham York Universtiy as a Computer Science student. My hobbies include racing and working on my project cars.

# Goals for this course
This course is challenging me to work on my teamwork skills currently facing issues with teammates having language barrier. I obviously would like to pass this course but also want to continue developing my social skills, as I am very introverted, and also further work on my teamwork skills.
